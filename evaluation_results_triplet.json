        "Stools that are hard are normally a result of a condition known as constipation. When the stools remain in the GI tract for more than 48 hours, any fluid contents in them was reabsorbed by the body. This causes the stool to become dry, hard and difficult to pass from the body. In exceedingly severe cases it may cause pain and bleeding while passing these stools. In the majority of cases, all it needs is a few home therapies. But in serious cases, it is vital to visit your doctor and understand the root cause.",
        "What is fecal incontinence? Fecal incontinence is the inability to control your bowel movements, causing stool (feces) to leak unexpectedly from your rectum. Also called bowel or anal incontinence, fecal incontinence can range from occasional leakage of a small quantity of stool while passing gas to a complete loss of bowel control. The ability to hold stool (called continence) requires the rectum, anus and nervous system to be working normally."
